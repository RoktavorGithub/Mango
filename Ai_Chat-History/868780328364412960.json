        "model": "One way to describe the color of the sky to a blind person is by using analogies and descriptions that they can relate to. You could say something like: \"The sky is like a vast, cool ocean stretching out above us. It is the color of a calm, peaceful lake on a sunny day.\" By using sensory language and comparisons to other experiences, you can help the blind person imagine the concept of the sky's color in a way that makes sense to them."
